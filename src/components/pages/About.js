                <p>I grew up in a small town in NC and after graduating high school moved to Wilmington NC to be by the beach. I got a job at a local automotive repair facilty and worked my way up the chain to a full time mechanic while also enjoying many of the features that my little coastal town has to offer. After spending many years in the Automotive industry I decided it was time to make a change and sought after further education and stumbled upon a program offerd by UNC for full stack web development. I hope that by completing this course I can rocket myself into a new chapter of my life filled with new challenges and rewards.</p>
